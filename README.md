## Features

- Control your mouse pointer using eye movements.
- Simple and user-friendly interface.
- Open-source and customizable.
- Works with various webcam models.
- Supports multiple operating systems.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/husnaindwergtgr/Eye-Detection-Mouse.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**  
   Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Eye-Detection-Mouse
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download and Execute the Application**  
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/husnaindwergtgr/Eye-Detection-Mouse/releases) to download the latest version. After downloading, execute the application as follows:
   ```bash
   python eye_detection_mouse.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, follow these steps:

1. **Setup Your Webcam**  
   Ensure your webcam is properly connected and positioned to capture your face.

2. **Calibrate the System**  
   Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the eye-tracking system.

3. **Start Using**  
   Move your eyes to control the mouse pointer. Use blinking or specific eye movements to perform clicks.

## How It Works

The Eye Detection Mouse uses computer vision techniques to detect and track your eyes. It processes the video feed from your webcam in real-time to determine the position of your gaze. The software then translates these movements into mouse actions.

1. **Face Detection**  
   The application first detects your face using Haar Cascades or similar algorithms.

2. **Eye Tracking**  
   Once your face is detected, the software identifies your eyes and tracks their movement.

3. **Mouse Control**  
   The system translates eye positions into mouse coordinates, allowing you to control the cursor.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used for development.
- **OpenCV**: A library for computer vision tasks, including image processing and eye detection.
- **Dlib**: A toolkit for machine learning and image processing.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for visualizing the tracking process.
